## Overview and Purpose

Originally made to create a self-learning tic-tac-toe robot.

The final product is a tic-tac-toe game played within the command line against another person. Unfortunately, I was unable to take advantage of the extension. I apologize for wasting your time. 

The execution of the program is relatively easy. Execute the tictactoe.exe, then press any number from 1-9 to indicate your choice of move. 1 is the top left corner, 2 being the top position, and continues onwards with a top to bottom, left to right scheme. "O" and "X" take turns with "O" starting first.
