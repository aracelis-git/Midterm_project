\subsection*{Overview and Purpose}

Originally made to create a self-\/learning tic-\/tac-\/toe robot.

The final product is a tic-\/tac-\/toe game played within the command line against another person. Unfortunately, I was unable to take advantage of the extension. I apologize for wasting your time.
